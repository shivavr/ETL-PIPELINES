Key Components
Custom GoodReads API Wrapper: Developed a Python wrapper for efficient data extraction
Modular ETL Jobs: Engineered flexible, reusable ETL modules
Cloud Data Warehouse: Utilized Amazon Redshift for high-performance analytics
Advanced Analytics Module: Implemented complex queries for actionable insights
Pipeline Workflow
Data Ingestion: API data is captured and stored in S3 landing zones
Data Processing:
ETL jobs transfer data from landing to working zones
Spark jobs apply transformations and optimize data partitioning
Processed data is moved to dedicated zones for further use
Data Warehousing:
Staging tables in Redshift receive processed data
UPSERT operations update the main Data Warehouse tables
Quality Assurance: Airflow DAGs perform comprehensive data quality checks
Analytics: Custom-designed operators execute analytical queries
Final Validation: Data quality checks on key analytics tables ensure accuracy
Technical Highlights
Infrastructure: Leveraged AWS EMR (3-node cluster) and Redshift (2-node cluster)
Orchestration: Implemented Apache Airflow with custom CloudFormation setup
Security: Utilized SSH tunneling for secure job submission
Scalability: Tested with 11.4GB of data processed every 10 minutes (1.6TB/day capacity)
Monitoring: Integrated email triggers for pipeline failure alerts
Challenges Overcome
Data Volume Scaling: Optimized for 100x data increase scenarios
Scheduling Flexibility: Configurable for various run-time requirements (e.g., daily 7AM runs)
Concurrency Management: Designed to handle 100+ simultaneous users
This project demonstrates my ability to architect end-to-end data solutions, optimize for scale, and deliver actionable insights in a cloud environment.
